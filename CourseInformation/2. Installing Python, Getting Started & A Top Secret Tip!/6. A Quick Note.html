<p>Since recording this, gist.github.com now requires a free signup in order to create gists. </p><p>I guess the service got so popular, that github wanted to reduce the load on their servers. Maybe it was all those python bible students ;)Â </p><p>Either way, a github account is free to create, and an essential tool for every serious programmer, so go ahead and make one! :)</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Ziyad</p>
